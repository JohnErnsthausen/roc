## Accomplishments in Project 3

1. compile without any warnings
1. run from command line arguments and from files. See top-level README for running unit tests and examples.
1. code is in C++ and must be fully object-oriented. Solver QRFactorization.c is plain c.
1. Concepts used (Must have 8)

    1. Constructors.
    2. Preservation of class invariants.
    3. Splitting the project into multiple files, with each class in its own file.
    4. Operator overloading.
    5. File input/output streams.
    6. User-defined templates.
    7. Standard template library containers.
    9. The C++ numerics library.
    10. Passing arguments to functions by (const) reference to prevent copying.
    11. Exceptions.

1. desired concepts

    1. Dynamic memory allocation. Checked via valgrind.
    2. String streams. Accomplished in examples_cpp/e_sevenbody.cpp.
    3. Class friendship and inheritance.
    5. Pointers.

1. avoid all of the common errors that I mention in the lecture notes
1. Do 7 of the following

    1. Debugging
    2. Optimizing. See flags in examples_cpp/Makefile
    3. Profiling. Via GPROF.
    4. Memory debugging. Via Valgrind.
    5. Smart pointers
    7. Makefiles
    8. Markdown
