1. compile without any warnings
1. run from command line arguments and from files
1. code is in C++ and must be fully object-oriented, except for QRFactorization.c which is plain c
1. Concepts used (Must have 8)

    1. Constructors.
    2. Preservation of class invariants.
    3. Splitting the project into multiple files, with each class in its own file (you could either have both a header file and a separate .cpp file, or put the entire class definition in the header file - your choice).
    4. Operator overloading.
    5. File input/output streams.
    6. User-defined templates (i.e. you must define your own templates).
    7. Standard template library containers (at least one of them).
    9. The C++ numerics library.
    10. Passing arguments to functions by (const) reference whenever possible, to prevent copying.
    11. Exceptions.

  Missing (Really cool concepts, but not needed)

    8. Standard template library algorithms.

1. desired concepts

    1. Dynamic memory allocation (but if you do this, make absolutely sure there are no memory leaks and that you properly define all the appropriate member functions such as destructors, copy constructors, and so on, as we learned in class).
    2. String streams.
    3. Class friendship and inheritance.
    4. Some of the less commonly used standard template library containers, such as deque, list, set, or map.
    5. Pointers.

1. avoid all of the common errors that I mention in the lecture notes
1. Do 7 of the following

    1. Debugging
    2. Optimizing
    3. Profiling
    4. Memory debugging
    5. Smart pointers
    7. Makefiles
    8. Markdown

  Missing (I'll try to install VSCode on windows. Perhaps my difficulty with VSCode is Ubuntu related)

    6. VS Code tasks
    9. Doxygen
